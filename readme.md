# ICE Debugger
A debugger for ICE Compiler. It's not so stable though, and not done yet. Note that the output program will be significantly bigger than normal.

## Usage
To load and setup the debugger, add `dbd(0)` at the start of your program. To open the debugger from anywhere in the code, use `dbd(1)`.
