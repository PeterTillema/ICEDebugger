# ICE Debugger
A debugger for ICE Compiler. It's not so stable though, and not done yet. Note that the output program will be slightly bigger than normal.

## Usage
When you compile a program with debug mode on, the compiled program automatically checks if the debugger is loaded on the calculator, and if so, sets up. *If the debugger is not present, the program will just quit without any warning!* To open the debugger from anywhere in the code, use `dbd(0)`.
